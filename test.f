s" Well, wrapping text would be a neat idea, but I'm not really sure if it's all you need. There are a great many other things that a good project needs, so wrapping text might not be the most important thing to start with. Also, I'm not sure whether I like this whole spacing out the text thing - I guess I'll have to think about it. Oh well."
